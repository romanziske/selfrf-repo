"""
This subpackage integrates Detectron2-based object detection into selfRF, providing tools and utilities for training, evaluation, and inference on RF spectrogram data. It includes configuration management, model wrappers, data mappers, and visualization functions adapted for RF signal tasks. Use this package to apply state-of-the-art computer vision models, such as Faster R-CNN, to RF datasets within the selfRF ecosystem.
